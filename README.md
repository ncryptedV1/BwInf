# BwInf
My solutions to the 37. (2018/19) &amp; 38. (2019/20) BwInf for the rounds 1 &amp; 2

# Prerequisites
Most of the solutions are written in Java, some in C++.
The docs are written with Word as of lacking knowledge of Tex back then.
The 37. BwInf has been my first participation in those kind of competitions with zero prior knowledge, except Java basics.
